# Data Dictionary (EN)

This document defines **features (metrics)** and **outcomes** used in the study.
All features are derived from StatsBomb Events & 360 data and are aligned to **event time**.
Outcomes aggregate the **next 5 minutes** (“+5”) from each event time.

## Common columns
- `match_id` – Numeric match identifier
- `sequence_id` – Possession/sequence key; `H…` for home, `A…` for away
- `minute`, `second` – Event time
- `team` – Event team (home/away)
- `is_home` – 1 if home, 0 if away

## Outcomes (5‑minute horizon)
- `xT_H_next5`, `xT_A_next5` – Sum of expected threat generated by **home/away** in the next 5 minutes.
- `xG_H_next5`, `xG_A_next5` – Sum of expected goals by **home/away** in the next 5 minutes.
- `hold_H_next5_share`, `hold_A_next5_share` – Share of ball possession of **home/away** in the next 5 minutes.

> When running panels with `target=self`, the outcome used is that of the event team.
> With `target=opp`, the **opponent** outcome is used (for defense panels).

## Attack metrics (examples actually used)
- `break_line_try`, `break_line_suc` – Attempts/success breaking an opposition defensive line.
- `zone14_pass_try`, `zone14_pass_suc` – Pass attempts/success into “zone 14” (central area outside the box).
- `box_pass_try`, `box_pass_suc` – Pass attempts/success into the penalty box.
- `shot_offpost_att`, `shot_saved_att`, `shot_blocked_att` – Shot outcome categories (attacking perspective).
- `seq_event_num` – Number of events in current attacking sequence.
- `seq_duration` – Duration of current attacking sequence (seconds).
- `att_miss` – Aggregated *negative* attacking actions (e.g., miscontrols, dispossessions), consolidated for stability.

## Defense metrics (examples actually used)
- `def_miss_pos_line` – Missed defensive position relative to defensive line (rate or count per event context).
- `def_suc` – Successful defensive actions (tackles, pressures, etc., task‑specific aggregation).
- `def_suc_pos_line_box` – Successful defensive actions in/around the box or relative to the line.
- `def_gain_dist` – Distance of ball recovery/defensive gain relative to own goal/line.
- `def_gap_mean`, `def_gap_std` – Mean/Std of inter‑defender spacing (from 360) at event time.
- `def_linegap_mean`, `def_linegap_std` – Mean/Std gap along the last defensive line.
- `seq_def_num` – Count of defensive sequence events.
- `shot_offpost_def`, `shot_blocked_def`, `shot_saved_def` – Shot outcomes conceded (defensive perspective).

> The exact feature list per panel is provided in `/outputs/ssm_pooled_all.csv` (column `metric`).


## Wide table columns (for model_wide_table.csv)
- **Identity & time:** `match_id`, `sequence_id`, `minute`, `second`, `team`, `is_home`
- **Outcomes:** `xT_*_next5`, `xG_*_next5`, `hold_*_next5_share`
- **Features:** all metrics actually used in the attack/defense panels (subset of the above)
